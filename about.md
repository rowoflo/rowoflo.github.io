I am an aspiring roboticist and current robotics PhD graduate student working with [Dr. Egerstedt](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~magnus/) in the [GRITS lab](http://http://gritslab.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu/). I moved to Atlanta in July 2011 after working for almost 3 years at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](http://www.ll.mit.edu/) where I worked on radar signal processing, tracking, and classification. Before that I received my BS and MS in electrical engineering (emphasis in control theory) from the [ECE department](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/) at [UCSB](http://www.ucsb.edu/). My current research focuses on the overlap between Control Theory and Machine Learning and its applications to mobile robotic systems.
