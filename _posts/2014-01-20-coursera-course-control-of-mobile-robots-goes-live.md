Today the [Control of Mobile Robots](https://class.coursera.org/conrob-002/class) course I am helping instruct goes live on Coursera. The course goes over the theory to make a mobile robot move in desirable ways (e.g avoiding obstacles). The course has both a simulator [Sim.I.am](http://jdelacroix.github.io/simiam/) (created by [JP de la Croix](http://jpdelacroix.com/)) and a hardware component, the QuickBot, created by me.
