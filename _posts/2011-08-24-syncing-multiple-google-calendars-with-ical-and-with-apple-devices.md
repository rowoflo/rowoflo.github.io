After a lot of searching I was able to get my Google account, Apple devices, and iCal app on my mac to all be in sync with multiple calendars.

First Google

The first thing that you need to do is set up your Google calendars. Go to your Google calendar page and create as many calendars as you desire in the left hand pane. Use the "My Calendars" tab "Create new calendar".

Second Mac

To set up your calendars in iCal (in Lion Mac OSX 10.7) goto "Systems Preferences" -> "Mail, Contacts, & Calendars". Click "Add Account" and "Microsoft Exchange" and put in your Google credentials (remember to include the @gmail.com at the end of your user name). This will set up your main calendar in iCal.

To get your other calendars goto iCal. Then goto "Preferences" -> "Accounts"  and select your Google account, then select the "Delegation" tab. In that window you can select each calendar you want to sync with iCal.

Third Apple Devices

To set up your calendars on each of your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) goto "Settings" -> "Mail, Contacts, & Calendars". Under "Accounts" click "Add Account"  and select "Microsoft Exchange". Fill in your credentials and leave the "Domain" field blank. Hit "Next" and when the "Server" field appears put "m.google.com". This will set up your main calendar.

To add your secondary calendars click "Add Account" again. Next, select "Other" then select "Add CalDAV Account". Again put in your credentials (again remember the @gmail.com), but this time under server put "www.google.com". Next, from your mobile device navigate to [www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect](http://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect) and select which calendars to sync to your mobile devices. Now your secondary calendars should be available in the native calendar app on your device.
