Recently I started working on a new project that is focused on competing in the new [Darpa  Robot Challenge](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Programs/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge.aspx). The robot that we will be using for that challenge is Hubo (shown in picture). For the challenge the humanoid robot is going to have to do some pretty incredible tasks (e.g. drive a vehicle, move rubble, break through walls, etc.) Watch the video below to get an idea.

Also, check out our Hubo cutting through a wall via teleoperation at [http://vimeo.com/57600990](http://vimeo.com/57600990)
